In the context that input is public you could achieve the same result in a publicly verifiable smart contract that computes Merkle root. Zero-Knowledge proofs are useful in any application where you do not want to divulge the statement, but you want to make the verifier rest assured that your statement is true. One of the applications could be online bidding. Right now, you have to deposit a x% amount of the bidding. If you will have an implemented zero knowledge proof, you could say look I have enough balance to bid without any restrictions of funds. And if your balance goes below, you canâ€™t bid anymore.
